files and setup to run a pi zero camera with diet pi and pisugar


The idea is to have a set of diet pi config files that install a os on a raspbery pi zero with a camera, a small LED panel with buttons to control the camera and see the pictures being taken, and a VNC server so one can see the pix on a computer.
